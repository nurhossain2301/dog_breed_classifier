# Project Goal
----
The goal of this project is to create a dog breed identification application using convolutional neural networks. It uses transfer learning and a model from scratch to detect dog breeds. It also utizie openCV for human detection. The resulting algorithm could be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
